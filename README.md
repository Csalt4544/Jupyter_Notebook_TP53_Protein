# Protein Bioinformatics: Analysis of TP53 Protein

This repository contains Jupyter files that detail some of the processes used to analyze the TP53 protein in the context of the development of cancer developed for the JHU class Protein Bioinformatics. 

Some of these processes introduced within the first Jupyter notebook file include the use of bioinformatics tools such as protein folding modelers, Python scripts, and web-based applications to observe the TP53 protein in wt and mutated states along with literature source references and other bioinformatics tools to suggest potential actionable areas that can be used in the pursuit of drug and treatment development for cancers such as those that occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

The second Jupyter notebook file includes a hypothetical experimental proposal of TP53 that utilizes some of the newer technologies and methods being used for mass-spectrometry based proteomic analysis.

While both Jupyter notebooks have been written to allow beginning to intermediate biologist to understand the process of analyzing the TP53 with no prior experience of bioinformatics, further research and exploration into the tools/programs/metholodgy/etc. is recommended to gain a deeper and more appreciative into the field.
